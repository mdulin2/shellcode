# What can be taken away from this?
- Knowing what type of values a function takes can be immensely valuable! Some functions will take unsigned variables, instead of signed.
- Truncating can occur when going from a variable a, that is larger to b, that is smaller. Be aware of this sort of truncating.
- Checks will often check for a positive value, but never even consider a negative, by passing the check all together.
